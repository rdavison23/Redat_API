# Weather App - Open API Project

## Running the Webpage Locally

Follow these steps to run this project on your local machine:

1. **Download the project files**

   - Clone this repository using:
     ```
     git clone <your-repo-url>
     ```
   - Or download the ZIP file and extract it to a folder.

2. **Open the HTML file**

   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. **Ensure an internet connection**
   - The API requests need an active connection to fetch weather data.

## Accessibility Improvements

- Buttons have been **increased in size** for easier tapping/clicking.
- Button text is now **larger** to improve readability for visually impaired users.

## Error Handling

- If API requests fail, the app will display an **error message** instead of blank elements.
- Users will see a message like: "Sorry, something went wrong. Try again later."
- This ensures non-technical users understand the issue without seeing complex error codes.
